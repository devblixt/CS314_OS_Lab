# Operating Systems Lab Assignments

//Informal Comments for juniors:

Lab 1: Just Minix Setup. No folder for this. 

Lab 2: A variety of things. I'm too lazy to type, but we used fork(), execvp() etc etc. Please check the folder!

Lab 3: Swapped PIDs are printed by modifying schedule files in Minix, plus we used UnixBench (modified by IIT Dharwad) to see how the Minix scheduler handles CPU bound and I/O bound processes.

Lab 4: Simulated SJF and SRTF schedulers in C++, since my roll number is even. 

Lab 5: Measuring time quanta allotted and order of execution for each process in a worklod mix (created by us), and then comparing it to after implementing a pseudo-FIFO scheduling

Lab 6: Image Transformation in sequential manner and using concurrency as well - four methods have been used, which are atomic operations, semaphores, shared memory and pipes. We (me and prabhu) had to do this in a hurry, so it's a knock-up job and you will need to improve the code if you want to use it. 

Lab 7: Some analysis of different virtual memory management methods- keeping base and bounds registers, segmenting memory spaces, and linear paging. 

Lab 8: Analysis of page replacement algorithms - FIFO, LRU and Random. 

Lab 9: Detecting creation, modification and deletion of files in the file system. 

Lab 10: Implementing immediate files in Minix. 

PS: Some stuff is a bit cluttery, please understand it yourself (it is self-explanatory (probably))
