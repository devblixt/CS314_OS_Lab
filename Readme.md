# Operating Systems Lab Assignments

//Informal Comments for juniors:

Lab 1: Just Minix Setup. No folder for this. 

Lab 2: A variety of things. I'm too lazy to type, but we used fork(), execvp() etc etc. Please check the folder!

Lab 3: Swapped PIDs are printed by modifying schedule files in Minix, plus we used UnixBench (modified by IIT Dharwad) to see how the Minix scheduler handles CPU bound and I/O bound processes.

Lab 4: Simulated SJF and SRTF schedulers in C++, since my roll number is even. 

Lab 5: Measuring time quanta allotted and order of execution for each process in a worklod mix (created by us), and then comparing it to after implementing a pseudo-FIFO scheduling

Lab 6: Image Transformation in sequential manner and using concurrency as well - four methods have been used, which are atomic operations, semaphores, shared memory and pipes. 

PS: Some stuff is a bit cluttery, please understand it yourself (it is self-explanatory (probably))
